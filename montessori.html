        <!-- <h2>Introduction to Montessori</h2> -->
            <!-- <figure class="maria-montessori">

        <p>The Montessori approach is an educational philosophy and method developed by Dr. Maria Montessori. It is centered on the belief that children are naturally curious, capable of self-directed learning, and have a unique potential for cognitive, emotional, and social development.</p>

        <h3>Unlocking Your Child's Potential with Montessori Education</h3>

        <p>At our daycares, we're committed to offering a holistic educational experience that nurtures your child's growth and curiosity. The Montessori method is at the heart of what we do, focusing on five key elements that play a pivotal role in your child's development. Let's explore these elements together:</p>

        <figure class="table-bottle-plates">
          <img src="./assets/images/table-bottle-plates.svg" alt="Table, bottle, plates, digital art (SVG).">
        </figure>

        <h3>Practical Life</h3>
        <p>Practical Life activities are fundamental to the Montessori approach, teaching children essential life skills and fostering independence. These activities include tasks such as pouring, buttoning, zipping, and setting a table.</p>

        <figure class="lhma-children">
          <img src="./assets/images/lhma-children/boy-setting-table.JPG" alt="A boy practicing practical life skills by setting the table with cutlery, a plate and a glass.">
        </figure>

        <p><span class="italics bold">Why Practical Life Matters:</span> Practical Life activities are designed to enhance fine and gross motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. They also teach children how to care for themselves and their environment. These skills lay the foundation for future learning and are vital for daily living.</p>

        <figure class="world-in-hands-plant">
          <img src="./assets/images/world-in-hands-plant.svg" alt="The Earth held in two hands, with a tiny plant sprouting from the top of the Earth, digital art (SVG).">
        </figure>

        <h3>Sensory:</h3>
        <p>Sensory development is a core component of Montessori education. It emphasizes the importance of engaging a child's senses in the learning process. Montessori classrooms are equipped with materials that stimulate the senses of touch, sight, sound, taste, and smell.</p>

        <figure class="lhma-children">
          <img src="./assets/images/lhma-children/girl-stacking-blocks.jpg" alt="A girl excitedly creating a tall structure of stacked red cylinders.">
        </figure>

        <!-- <figure class="lhma-children">
          <img src="./assets/images/lhma-children/girl-carving-pumpkin.JPG" alt="A girl engaging in Montessori sensory play by carving a pumpking (with educator supervision).">
        </figure> -->

        <p><span class="italics bold">Why Sensory Development Matters:</span> Sensory experiences help children understand and process the world around them. It promotes cognitive growth, emotional regulation, and problem-solving skills. Sensory activities engage the child's whole being, making learning more meaningful.</p>

        <figure class="communicate">
          <img src="./assets/images/communicate.svg" alt="Two persons exchanging information and ideas, digital art (SVG).">
        </figure>

        <h3>Language:</h3>
        <p>The Montessori approach recognizes that language is central to learning. Language activities in Montessori classrooms encourage spoken language, reading, and writing. Children learn phonics, vocabulary, and reading comprehension through a carefully designed sequence of materials.
        </p>

        <p><span class="italics bold">Why Language Development Matters:</span> Strong language skills are crucial for communication and academic success. Montessori language activities enable children to become proficient readers and confident communicators, setting the stage for a lifetime of literacy and learning.</p>

        <figure class="maths-tools">
          <img src="./assets/images/maths-tools.svg" alt="A circle, a cylinder, and a mathematical compass, digital art (SVG).">
        </figure>

        <h3>Math:</h3>
        <p>Montessori math activities are designed to help children understand abstract mathematical concepts through concrete experiences. They work with specialized materials, such as the Number Rods and Spindle Boxes, to explore number sense, operations, and geometry.</p>

        <figure class="lhma-children">
          <img src="./assets/images/lhma-children/girl-drawing-cirlce.JPG" alt="A girl drawing a circle using Montessori methods.">
        </figure>

        <p><span class="italics bold">Why Math Development Matters:</span> Mathematical thinking is a cornerstone of intellectual development. Montessori math materials provide a solid foundation for mathematical concepts, fostering problem-solving, logical thinking, and a love for numbers.</p>

        <figure class="louvre">
          <img src="./assets/images/louvre.svg" alt="The Louvre Museum, digital art (SVG).">
        </figure>

        <h3>Culture:</h3>
        <p>Cultural education in Montessori extends beyond geography and history. It introduces children to various aspects of the world, including science, botany, zoology, and cultural diversity. Children explore concepts like the parts of a flower, landforms, and world cultures.</p>

        <figure class="lhma-children">
          <img src="./assets/images/lhma-children/boy-and-girl-wooden-puzzle.JPG" alt="A boy and a girl working together to complete a wooden puzzle of a horse.">
        </figure>

        <p><span class="italics bold">Why Cultural Education Matters:</span> Cultural education broadens children's horizons and instills a sense of wonder and respect for the world. It encourages curiosity and a lifelong appreciation of diverse cultures, nature, and the interconnectedness of all life.</p>

        <ul class="montessori-intro-list">
                <h4>Other key principles of the Montessori approach include:</h4>
                <li>1. <span class="italics bold">Child-Centered Learning:</span> The approach focuses on the child's interests and needs, allowing them to choose their activities and learn at their own pace.</li>
                <li>2. <span class="italics bold">Mixed-Age Classrooms:</span> Montessori classrooms often have mixed-age groups, allowing younger children to learn from older peers and vice versa.</li>
                <li>3. <span class="italics bold">Hands-On Learning:</span> Learning materials in Montessori classrooms are designed to be hands-on and self-correcting, promoting independent exploration.</li>
                <li>4. <span class="italics bold">Freedom within Limits:</span> Children have a degree of freedom to choose activities, but they also learn to respect boundaries and engage in tasks that foster responsibility.</li>
                <li>5. <span class="italics bold">Respect for the Child:</span> Montessori educators deeply respect the individuality of each child and aim to nurture their physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development.</li>
                <li>6. <span class="italics bold">Uninterrupted Work Periods:</span> Extended, uninterrupted work periods allow children to immerse themselves in tasks, promoting concentration and problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li>7. <span class="italics bold">Prepared Environment:</span> Montessori classrooms are carefully designed to provide a rich, stimulating, and orderly environment that encourages exploration and discovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Montessori approach has been widely adopted in early childhood education but can extend into elementary and even secondary education. It emphasizes holistic development and a love for learning, fostering independence, critical thinking, and a strong sense of self.</p>
